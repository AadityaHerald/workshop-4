<p>Grand Theft Auto V is an action-adventure video game that was created by Rockstar North and released by Rockstar Games in 2013. It is the fifteenth installment overall and the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. The single-player narrative is set in the made-up nation of San Andreas, which is modeled after Southern California, and follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips—as they attempt to pull off heists while being pressured by a dishonest government organization and ruthless criminals. The fictitious metropolis of Los Santos, which is modeled after Los Angeles, and the wide countryside of San Andreas are both accessible to players in the open world concept.>
